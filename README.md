Goal 
Webbased application for generating CAP cancer synoptic report

Aim
Standardize pathology report and mapped with SNOMED code

How to use
- Load the file and place it somewhere on your computer that can easily access (eg, desktop). The file will be a .HTML file.
- Choose the answer in each parameter
- Copy the report and pasted on your HIS system.

No integration into the HIS system or installation needed.

Perks
- Use radio buttons rather than a dropdown menu for less clicking per report
- Have already selected the "most common" choice for less clicking per report (for colon = pT3 mod adenoCA, LVI-, PNI-)
- Link the extent of the tumor and select the pT automatically
- Link the number of positive lymph nodes and calculate the pN automatically
